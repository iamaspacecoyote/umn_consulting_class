## My UMN Journey

- B.S. and M.S. math degrees from University of Minnesota - Duluth (2006; 2008)

- PhD in statistics from University of Minnesota - Twin Cities (2016)
    + Teaching Assistant for multiple courses in 5 semesters
    + Fellowships for 4 semesters
    + Student consulting in School of Stats consulting center for 1 semester

    + Independent tutor and statistical consultant

---

## Summer Consulting Work (2013)

- Following my 2nd year of PhD study, I worked in Dr. Patricia Frazier's Psychology Lab for ~20 hrs/week for 8 weeks

- She and her lab group were studying the impact of an intervention on student stress
     + They measured student stress at various time points before and after the intervention
     
- Another statistics student and I fit a linear mixed model to the data and contributed to the [final published work](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10615806.2014.987666#.VNthNmTF9_0)

- Some projects I worked on:
    + [Nonlinear mixed effects model for fish behavior](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10886-017-0833-0)
    + Survival analysis on animal distress following surgery
    + [Permutation testing on brainstorming ](https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/mechanicaldesign/article-abstract/137/7/071403/376216/Large-Scale-Needfinding-Methods-of-Increasing-User?redirectedFrom=fulltext)

## Reflections on Consulting Work

 - Problem solving 
 - Code first data science
    + Creating reusable code for handoff to lab team
 - Communication
    + Teach a new method or interpreting results for unfamiliar audiences
    + Becoming a two-way filter
 - Learning specific statistical methods that each field utilizes
 - Writing technical documentation

## Stress Testing

.left-column[
*The Federal Reserve estimates the effect of supervisory scenarios on the regulatory capital ratios of firms participating in the supervisory stress test by projecting net income and other components of regulatory capital for each firm over a nine-quarter projection horizon. Projected net income, adjusted for the effect of taxes, is combined with non-common capital action assumptions and other components of regulatory capital to produce post-stress capital ratios.*

## Quantitative Model Validation - Key Skills

 - Risk identification 
     - Can you identify where a model might be conceptually flawed or performing poorly?  Can you design testing to assess your hypotheses? 
 - Reading, running, and updating code
     - Are you familiar with R, Python, SAS, Matlab, Stata, C, C++, Fortran, etc.?
     - How would you prioritize which code to review?
 - Collaboration 
     - How can you leverage expertise around you to learn and critically assess models in a short period of time?
 -  Technical writing 
     - Can you communicate your work and conclusions in detail and in a useful executive summary?

## Transitioning to Quantitative Leadership and Management

Some key changes I've experienced going from an independent contributor to a leader/manager:

 - You are directly dependent on others to meet your goals
 - You are responsible for the work of others and for doing work for your managers
 - Buy-in of colleagues and staff is now essential to move projects forward
 - Prioritization is important to gaining buy-in on short- and long-term vision
 - Decisions have to be made without information or time to dig in
 - You need to use your "political capital" wisely
